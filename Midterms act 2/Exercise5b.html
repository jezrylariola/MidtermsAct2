<h1 style="font-size: 40pts;text-align:center;font-family:Lucida Calligraphy;">Chicken Adobo</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family: Times New Roman;">The chicken adobo is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process in Philippine cuisine.It involves the meat(chicken), marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns, which is browned in oil, and simmered in the marinade. It has occasionally been considered the unofficial national dish in the Philippines. The cooking method for the Philippine adobo is indigenous to the Philippines. Pre-colonial Filipinos often cooked or prepared their food with vinegar and salt to keep them fresh longer in the tropical climate of the Philippines. Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with four main traditional types: coconut vinegar, cane vinegar, nipa palm vinegar, and kaong palm vinegar, all of which are linked to traditional alcohol fermentation.</p>
